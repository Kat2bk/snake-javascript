# snake-javascript

practicing--with--javascript

<!-- thinking -->

must have a CLI to display snake component...??
must be translated into GUI...?
component must move around
there must be an item that is randomized
component must reset itself when it hits any corner of UI

<!-- learning -->

Learned about canvas tag... must set width and height
usually there is a main.min.js file where all files are uploaded from other files

base.js... defines global functions
ui-interface.js is entry point for web application
